# Coin Watch

A fully-responsive website that displays real time cryptocurrency data provided by the Coin Gecko API. The application can show price changes over time, a description of each asset, and also show the latest crypto news gathered from GNews.
The main purpose of this project was to implement a Redux store that could fetch data from the API, and use that data in the react components.

#### Disclaimer

Since both APIs used for the project are on free plans, there might be scenaros in which the application won't fetch data due to request limits.
